# MineColony ComputerCraft

An All-In-One script for all your MineColony needs that is easily expandable.

To be honest, this was created cause I was bored while playing ATM9, so I started MineColonies. Started with a script for to check if the colonist are asleep, so I can use a tablet of sunrise to reset it back to day. Then I wanted to have refined storage autocraft the requests for me. I didn't like the idea of both of them being on different monitors, so I decided to create this. Inspired to make the graphical interface similar to the [extreme reactor script](https://github.com/Kasra-G/ReactorController).
